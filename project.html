              1. LPG Gas Leakage Detector using Arduino :   </span> <br>
              While LPG is an essential need of every household, its leakage could lead to a disaster. To alert on LPG leakage and prevent any mishappening there are various products to detect the leakage. Here we have developed an Arduino based LPG gas detector alarm. If gas leakage occurs, this system detects it and makes an alert by buzing the buzzer attached with the circuit. This system is easy to build and anyone who have some knowledge of electronics and programing, can build it..
              We have used a LPG gas sensor module to detect LPG Gas. When LPG gas leakage occurs, it gives a HIGH pulse on its DO pin and arduino continuously reads its DO pin. When Arduino gets a HIGH pulse from LPG Gas module it shows “LPG Gas Leakage Alert” message on 16x2 LCD and activates buzzer which beeps again and again until the gas detector module doesn't sense the gas in environment. When LPG gas detector module gives LOW pulse to arduino, then LCD shows “No LPG Gas Leakage” message.

            2.  Path Finder Visualizer: <br>
            The goal of this project is to create a web based e-Learning tool, ‘Pathfinding Visualizer’, which can be
used to visualize shortest path algorithms. The conceptual application of the project is illustrated by
implementation of algorithms like BFS , A* and DFS.<br><br>
